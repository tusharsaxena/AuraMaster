# 02 — Candidates

Sources: `git -C ../LibKa0s log --oneline v1.68.0..v1.68.1` (7 commits), the `CHANGELOG.md` v1.68.1
block (lines 13-53 at the tag), and `docs/api/testkit/version-36-docs.md` at the tag. No major moved a
minor (01_DELTA 3c), so there is no per-major API document to diff and no `Since` marker in range.

## A. Delivered on the copy

- Kit revision 36: the runner prints `/dev-copilot:bump-version` in the `RESULTS.md` lead-in where
  revision 35 printed `/wow-addon:bump-version`, and three runner comments plus one `test_eol.lua`
  header comment name the `dev-copilot` commands and path (CHANGELOG v1.68.1, lines 28-41;
  `version-36-docs.md:33-43`). This addon's next automated-test run rewrites that one `RESULTS.md`
  line on its own. Nothing else in the runner's output, manifest or case list changes.

## B. New surfaces (host change required)

None. The release adds no member, row type, descriptor field or seam (CHANGELOG v1.68.1, lines 15-19:
"No LibStub minor moves, no `NEEDS_*` floor rises, no member is added or removed").

## C. Whole-module adoption

None. No major is added in this range; `LibKa0s-Item-1.0` stays unbound, as before, and is unchanged.

**Zero adoption candidates.** The Step 6 interview has no items and was not held.
